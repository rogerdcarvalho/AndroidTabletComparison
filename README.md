# AndroidTabletComparison
A sample app that compares tablets based on specs and advises the user which one is the best

# How it works
Tablet data is provided via a XML file (tablets.xml in assets). The app parses this info using a 'Tablet' and a 'Specification' class. Users can then select which of the tablets they would like to compare and the app then recommends which one in the selection has the best specifications.
